# Unsecured Credit Card

An unsecured credit card is any credit card that is not tied to an account holder’s savings account. It does not require that the account holder pay the balance in full each month and allows the consumer to carry over any balance (“revolve”) with interest being charged on that balance - unless the account is delinquent (in which case different rules apply), or the balance is equal to or less than the minimum payment.
