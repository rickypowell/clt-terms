# Curbstoning

A curbstones (someone in the business of curbstoning) is anyone who sells a car who is not a licensed dealer. While there are many legitimate private sellers in the used car market who sell their own cars (which they have owned and driven), a curbstoner is someone who buys a car and then turns around and sells it without owning it for any length of time. In addition to not being licensed, some of the vehicles that they sell have been wrecked or water damaged in other states, had their titles washed, and are sold to unsuspecting buyers.
