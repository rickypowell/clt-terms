# Deficiency Balance

A deficiency balance occurs when the value of a vehicle doesnâ€™t cover the amount of the outstanding debt. This can happen when a vehicle is repossessed and the price the vehicle receives at auction, plus any repossession and auction fees, is less than the outstanding loan balance.

When this happens, the lender can take certain steps (including legal action) to recover the remaining debt, which is called a deficiency balance.
