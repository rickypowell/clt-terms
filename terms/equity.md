# Equity

Vehicle equity is the ownership interest that you have in a vehicle. In automotive terms, there is equity in a vehicle if the value of it (at wholesale) is greater than the loan balance. If the owner holds a clear title to the vehicle (no lienholder), then the equity is the wholesale value of the vehicle. If the loan isnâ€™t paid off, then the equity is the difference between the wholesale value and the loan payoff amount.
