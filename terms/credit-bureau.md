# Credit Bureau

A credit bureau is a company that provides consumer credit information on individual borrowers. This information helps lenders evaluate creditworthiness, which is a measure of the ability of a borrower to pay back a loan, and can affect the interest rate applied to a loan (interest are based on risk-based pricing based on the expected costs of different borrowers as measured by their credit scores).
