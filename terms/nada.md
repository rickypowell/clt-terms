# NADA

NADA is the National Automobile Dealers Association. It was founded in 1917 by a group of retail new car dealers. NADA started with a group of 130 dealers. In 1975, NADA constructed a new headquarters building in McLean, Virginia.

NADA promotes the interests of retail automotive dealers through lobbying efforts and political contributions. It also develops research data about the automobile industry and operates training and service programs to improve dealership business, sales and service practices. 

A division of NADA also publishes late model used car information in printed and electronic format. In addition to print guides, the NADA Official Used Car Guide Company publishes a variety of vehicle data in electronic format, including online and CD-ROM information. 

Most consumers, however, donâ€™t have access to this information and instead, the NADAguides website is what most will encounter. NADAguides has been owned and operated by J.D. Power since 2015.
