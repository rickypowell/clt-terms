# Invoice Price

The invoice price is the manufacturer's initial charge for a new vehicle to a retail dealer. This price always includes destination (delivery) charges. While the invoice price reflects the cost of a vehicle to the dealer, it may not reflect the final cost, since possible manufacturer-to-dealer rebates, additional manufacturer discounts, incentive awards (for volume), and money held back until the actual sale (dealer holdback money) the dealer may receive can lower the final vehicle cost to the dealer.
