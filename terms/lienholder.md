# Lienholder

A lienholder is the party, usually a bank or finance company, which holds a secured interest in the automobile (the secured interest is a passive right to retain – but not sell – the automobile) until the debt is discharged (paid off).

In most states, the lienholder information is listed on the vehicle title along with the name and address of the vehicle buyer.
