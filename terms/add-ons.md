# Add-ons

Sometimes called “dealer adds”, these are optional features added on to a car, usually before delivery, usually by a dealer. The most common add-ons include undercoating (rust proofing), alarm systems and vehicle tracking devices, window tinting, fabric and paint protection and pin-striping. In many cases, these items are often overpriced and are used as a way to increase the selling price of the car. Also known as “dealer charges” and “dealer-installed options.”
