# Vehicle Title

A vehicle title (also called a car title) is a form that establishes legal ownership of a vehicle. This legal document is issued by a state Department of fMotor Vehicles (DMV) or, in some states, the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office. Although titles differ from state to state, they normally list the following information:

<ol>
    <li>Vehicle Identification number (VIN)</li>
    <li>Year, make and body style</li>
    <li>Vehicle weight (sometimes listed as gross vehicle weight) and some type of classification relating to purchase price or vehicle base price</li>
    <li>The name and address of the registered vehicle owner</li>
    <li>If the vehicle is being financed, the name of the lienholder (legal owner until the loan is paid off) to whom the money is owed.</li>
</ol>
