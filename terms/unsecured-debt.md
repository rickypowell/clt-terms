# Unsecured Debt

Unsecured debt refers to loans that are not backed by collateral. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may not be able to recover their investment because the borrower is not required to pledge any specific assets as security for the loan. A credit card account balance is an example of unsecured debt.
