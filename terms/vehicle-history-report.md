# Vehicle History Report

A vehicle history report is a collection of data that represents a history of events related to a specific car. These events are then presented in chronological report form along with notes indicating any discrepancies or red flags resulting from the information. There are a number of services (Carfax, AutoCheck) that, for a fee, will furnish one of these reports, but the information should be regarded with caution, since there are a number of agencies, most notably some insurance companies, that do not make their data available for mining.
