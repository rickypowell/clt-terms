# Addendum Sticker

An addendum sticker, sometimes called an additional equipment sticker, is a smaller label that you may sometimes find next to the Monroney label on the window of a new car at a car dealership.

## Purpose

The addendum label is there to inform the consumer that the MSRP (Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price) listed on the Monroney label has been changed by the dealer to reflect the additional cost of the car.

## Additional Items that can raise the cost of a car

These additional items can include “hard ads” (hardware upgrades) such as different wheels, roof racks and brush guards; “soft ads” (not a hardware upgrade) such as paint protection, rust proofing or fabric protection; or even “market price adjustments” (raising the price of a vehicle because of high market demand).

## How to read the addendum label

The label should include a description of the vehicle as well as a VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) that matches the one on the Monroney label next to it. Next, it will list the MSRP of the vehicle. Below the MSRP line is an individual list of additional equipment along with the corresponding prices of these options. At the bottom of the form is the subtotal of these additions. The bottom line of the form has the “dealer’s asking price”, which is the total of the MSRP plus the additional cost(s). Next to the asking price is a statement: Not the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price, so that there is no confusion as to who changed the vehicle price.
