# Lease Termination Fee

Most vehicle leases contain a termination fee. This is a fee charged by the leasing company once the lease is completed to cover expenses at the end of the lease (such as picking the car up and shipping it to the auction to be sold).

Read any lease carefully before signing it. While some lessors donâ€™t charge a termination fee, others have been known to charge $350.00 or more. At the same time, most captive lenders will waive this fee if you immediately lease another vehicle through them.
