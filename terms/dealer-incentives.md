# Dealer incentives

Dealer incentives are special programs offered by automobile manufacturers to help their dealers sell cars and/or reduce inventory. These savings are sometimes passed on to buyers as a reduction in the selling price of the vehicle. Unlike customer rebates, dealer incentives are not always advertised by the manufacturer or the dealer.
