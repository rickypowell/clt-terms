# Paint Protection

Paint protection or paint sealant is a (usually) Teflon-based product that is applied to a vehicleâ€™s painted surfaces by hand, much like a car wax, and then buffed to a shine by electric buffer. While this product was originally much longer-lasting than products offered by aftermarket companies such as Simonize and Turtle Wax, the same Teflon-based product, along with other newly-developed waxes, are now available in the aftermarket at much lower prices (dealers have been known to charge anywhere from $100-$300 for this procedure) than dealer-applied products.
