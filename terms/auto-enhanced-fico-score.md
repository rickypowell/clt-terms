# Auto Enhanced FICO Score

When consumers pay for a FICO score, the score that they see may not be the same score that an auto lender uses. That's because dealers and lenders pay for access to the FICO auto-enhanced credit score. This score is calculated in a different way, because it is greatly influenced by a borrower's auto loan and/or lease payment history and puts more weight (emphasis) on auto loan activity including on-time payments, late auto loan and lease payments, auto repossessions, and auto loans discharged in bankruptcies.
