# Selling Price

The selling price of a vehicle is the negotiated price of the vehicle (usually less than the MSRP), that includes the destination charge. The selling price does not include taxes, government fees, dealer fees (such as a documentation fee) or additional back-end products such as credit life insurance or a vehicle service contract.
