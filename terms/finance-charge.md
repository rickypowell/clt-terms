# Finance Charge

According to the laws of the United States, a finance charge is any fee representing the cost of credit or the cost of borrowing. In addition to interest, other charges such as financial transaction fees are considered finance charges. It can also be considered, more simply, as the dollar amount paid to borrow money.
