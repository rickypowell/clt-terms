# Direct Lending

Directly lending is the process of applying for a loan from a bank, credit union or other lending institution by dealing directly with the lender. Unlike indirect lending, the applicant applies for the loan either at a brick-and-mortar location, or at the lenderâ€™s web site.

In direct lending, the lending institution is responsible for the preparation, execution and submission of all loan-related documents.

One drawback of direct lending is that unless you are a current customer, many captive finance companies will not allow you to directly apply for a loan.
