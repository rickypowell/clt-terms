# Veterans Car Loans

These are car loans that are extended to United States military veterans. They include loans that are made to veterans of the United States Army, Army National Guard, United States Navy, United States Air Force, United States Marines and United States Coast Guard. While the Veterans Administration guarantees mortgage loans given to eligible veterans to protect the lenders against loss (commonly called a VA Loan), there are no government programs in place that would guarantee car loans to military veterans.
