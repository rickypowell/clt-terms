# Car Dealership

A car dealership is a business that buys vehicles from, and sells vehicles to the public at the retail level. New car dealers are authorized to sell a manufacturerâ€™s new cars based on a contract with an automaker or its sales subsidiary. Dealers that sell only used cars have no contract with a manufacturer and are often called independent dealers. Both types of dealerships are licensed and regulated by the state in which they do business.
