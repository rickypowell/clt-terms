# Off Lease Vehicle

An off-lease car is a vehicle that's been returned to a dealer at the end of its lease. Generally off-lease cars have been gently used. Most manufacturers, through their captive lending companies, allow their dealers to buy these vehicles and sell them, with many of these vehicles qualifying for the manufacturerâ€™s certified pre owned vehicle program.
