# Credit History

A credit history is the record from a number of sources, including banks, credit card companies, collection agencies, and governments, of how a person has managed his or her credit in the past, including total debt, the  number of credit lines, and timeliness of payments. Lenders look at a potential customer's credit history to decide whether or not to offer a new line of credit, and to help set the terms of the loan.
