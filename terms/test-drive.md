# Test Drive

A test drive is a hands-on research tool in which a potential buyer drives a vehicle in order to test it for overall handling, feel, and performance. A good test drive will also include a vehicle walk-around presentation by the salesperson to explain the vehicleâ€™s various features and equipment.
