# Debtor Education Course

The Debtor Education Course is the “ticket out” of bankruptcy. Thanks to BAPCPA (Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005) that made several significant changes to American bankruptcy laws , the debtor education course is a requirement for all bankruptcy petitioners who wish to receive a discharge from the bankruptcy court. The practical skills taught in the debtor education course are meant to be useful to petitioners in their post-bankruptcy life. Concepts covered include money handling, debt management and more.
