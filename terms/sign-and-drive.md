# Sign and Drive

Sign and drive is a type of retail automotive lease. In a standard lease, the fees usually due at lease signing are the first payment (since leases are paid in advance), a security deposit (usually the base payment, plus tax, rounded up to the next dollar amount) and all title and plate fees, plus any dealer fees (such as a documentation fee).

A sign and drive lease eliminates the first payment and security deposit. At lease inception, the lessee is only responsible for the title, plate and dealer fees. Essentially, the lessee <ins>signs</ins> the paperwork and <ins>drives</ins> away with the vehicle.
