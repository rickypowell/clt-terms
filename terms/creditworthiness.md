# Creditworthiness

Creditworthiness or credit potential is a measure of a borrowers ability to repay loans based on past  experience. Previous car loan payment history is an example. Most lenders employ their own rules to rank potential customers according to risk, although most also use the FICO credit scoring tool to determine a customerâ€™s credit potential.
