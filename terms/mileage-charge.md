# Mileage Charge

Sometimes called an “excess mileage charge”, it is a fee charged by the lessor if a leased car exceeds the mileage limit written into the contract. The fee is based on the total accumulated mileage of the vehicle at the end of the lease ( i.e., if the lease is a 3 year 36,000 mile lease, the total mileage at the end of three years would have to be over 36,000 miles to incur any over-mileage fees. Lessees could drive 24,000 miles the first year and 6,000 miles per year for the next 2 years and still not be charged an excess mileage fee).
