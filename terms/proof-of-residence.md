# Proof of Residence

Proof of residence is a requirement of most subprime lenders. It is proof, in the form of a mortgage statement, rental or lease agreement or utility bill, of an applicant’s stated place of residence listed on a credit application. The statement or bill must show the address as well as the applicant’s name. Unlike conventional lenders, subprime (bad credit) lenders require a borrower to furnish this proof in order to establish ownership or legal residence.
