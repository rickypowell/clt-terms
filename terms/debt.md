# Debt

The simplest form of debt is a loan. Before a debt is assumed, both the borrower and the creditor have to agree on how it is to be repaid. This agreement, called a contract, calls for payments to be paid made over a fixed period of time by a certain date. The sum to be paid back usually includes the amount borrowed plus interest charges.
