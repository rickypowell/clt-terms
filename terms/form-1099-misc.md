# Form 1099 Misc

A 1099 Misc is a form used to report income other than wages, salaries and tips (a W-2 form is used for those types of income). In order to qualify for a 1099 form, workers must be, according to the IRS, independent contractors (non-employees) not subject to normal work rules by their employers.
