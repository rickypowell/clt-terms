# Lessor

A lessor is a company that provides temporary use of a vehicle in return for periodic (usually monthly) payments. An example of a lessor would be GM Financial (General Motors lending subsidiary), Ford Motor Credit or American Honda Finance Corporation, all of which are captive finance companies.
