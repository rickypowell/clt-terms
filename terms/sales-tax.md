# Sales Tax

Generally speaking, a sales tax is a tax on consumer goods that is usually charged to the buyer at the time of the sale. It is usually a percentage of the sale price of the item. In most instances, the rate is set by the state in which the item is purchased. In some states, certain municipalities (such as cities and counties) are allowed to add an additional percentage to the tax.
