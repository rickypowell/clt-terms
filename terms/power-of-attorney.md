# Power of Attorney

A power of attorney is a legal document that authorizes one person to act on behalf of another in a legal or business matter. The person authorized to act is the agent, while the person authorizing the other to act is the principal or granter. An example of when a power of attorney is needed would be when a title to a vehicle needs to be transferred and the individual on the title is unable to appear at the DMV office. In this case, someone holding power of attorney for the owner of the vehicle would be able to complete the transfer without the ownerâ€™s presence.
