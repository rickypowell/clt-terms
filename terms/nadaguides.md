# NADAguides

The NADA Official Used Car Guide was originally a book that dealerships used to evaluate the market value of used cars. It has since become a website that many dealers still use. But most consumers don't have access to it, and instead the NADAguides website is what most they will encounter. NADAguides has been owned and operated by J.D. Power since 2015.
