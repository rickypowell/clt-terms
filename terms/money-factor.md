# Money Factor

This is what confuses most people when it comes to leases. The money factor is actually pretty simple. It just refers to the interest rate, but is calculated differently. Like residual values, captive finance companies can adjust the money factor up or down to adjust the monthly lease price.

The money factor is represented as a number such as ".0029". To convert this to a more familiar interest rate, you simply multiply by 2,400. A money factor of .0029 equals roughly 7% interest.

Here's a table showing you what each money factor converts to:
