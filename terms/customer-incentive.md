# Customer Incentive

Sometimes called a “rebate”, a customer incentive is a program from an auto manufacturer that offers either money - in the form of cash or a discount - or a subvented (artificially reduced) finance rate (from a captive finance company), or both, on a particular vehicle to increase sales and/or reduce excess inventory.
