# Fabric Protection

Interior fabric protection is a solvent-based spray usually applied icy the service department of a car dealership to protect the fabric seats and carpeted floors and floor mats in new vehicles. While this solvent-based product may be longer-lasting than water-based products such as 3M&apos;s original Scotchgard&trade;, newer Scotchgard&trade; products and their like are much more durable. In addition, dealerships have been known to charge anywhere from $100-$300 for this dealer-applied product for a simple procedure that most buyers could perform at home for a fraction of the cost.
