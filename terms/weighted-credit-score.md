# Weighted Credit Score

A weighted credit score is a credit score that is generated differently than a standard credit score. For example, a vehicle-weighted credit score will place more emphasis on vehicle loan payment history.

The reason for these specialty scores is that although banks and finance companies that originate car loans are interested in an overall credit history, they are particularly interested in how applicants have paid on their car loans. Depending on how a borrower has paid their car loans in the past, a vehicle-weighted credit score can be higher or lower their regular credit score.
