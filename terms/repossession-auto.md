# Repossession (Auto)

Also known as involuntary repossession, repossession happens when an auto lender takes possession of a vehicle, sometimes without advanced warning or requiring permission from the court. Vehicle repossession laws vary by state; the vehicle purchase contract should include details about how and when the auto lender can repossess a vehicle.
