# Destination Charge

A destination charge, also referred to as “delivery charge “ or “transportation charge”, is the amount listed on a Monroney Label that a manufacturer charges for delivery from the port (for imported automobiles) or the assembly plant (for domestically produced automobiles) to a car dealership. It is usually a flat fee that does not take into consideration how far the dealership is from the point of manufacture or import (other than, typically, Alaska and Hawaii).
