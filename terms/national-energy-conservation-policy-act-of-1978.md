# National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978

Usually referred to as the National Energy Act of 1978, it was created in response to the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and the subsequent energy crises that it created in the United States. It was later amended by **The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007**.

It was predated by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 which addressed the need for strategic petroleum reserves. The 1978 act was designed to encourage energy conservation as well as the implementation of alternative, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. It also set goals for automobile gas mileage (**Corporate Average Fuel Economy**) as well as establishing the **Gas Guzzler Tax** for vehicles that failed to meet minimum mileage standards.

## Energy Tax Act

This portion of the Energy Act was created specifically to encourage energy conservation by promoting fuel efficiency and renewable energy through tax credits for promoting efficiency and taxes for inefficient motor vehicles â€“ otherwise known as the **Gas Guzzler Tax**.
