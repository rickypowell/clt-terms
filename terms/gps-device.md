# GPS Device

A GPS device is an electronic on-demand vehicle recovery and anti theft device. Buy-here-pay-here (BHPH), tote the note, and in-house financing dealers primarily use these devices to locate vehicles for repossession when borrowers fail to make their monthly payments on time (known in the repossession business as asset recovery).
