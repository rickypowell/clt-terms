# Rustproofing

Sometimes called rust protection, rustproofing is the spray-on application of a bitumen-based or wax-based product that contains anti-rust chemicals. This process is usually done at a car dealership or a service center that specializes in vehicle aftermarket applications.

This process was particularly popular in the 1950’s to the 1980’s. With new methods of body design and corrosion protection, the need for rustproofing is almost nonexistent. Most new vehicles come with rust perforation warranties of 7 to 10 years and the addition of aftermarket rustproofing can actually void a rust perforation warranty.
