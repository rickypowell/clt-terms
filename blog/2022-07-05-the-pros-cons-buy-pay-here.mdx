If you’ve been turned down for a subprime car loan and have a down payment either with a trade-in or in cash, shopping for a vehicle at a buy here pay here car lot can be great for getting the vehicle you need right now. But if you’re looking for a deal, or, in many cases, for a way to improve your credit, financing a car at one of these dealerships may not be the way to go.

## The last stop

If you’re reading this article, we’re going to assume that you’ve tried every other way to get financed for a car loan. That means applying for a loan through your credit union or a bank that you do business with first and, if you were turned down and have a down payment or trade in, going to a large franchised new car dealership with a special finance department or a big used car lot such as CarMax and getting turned down there.

## On one hand

You should always try those sources first because there are several drawbacks to going through in-house financing. Those drawbacks include:

High interest rates: Most of these lots charge high interest rates - in many cases the state maximum - to offset the risks that come with these loans. 

Large down payments: These dealers finance the vehicles on their lots themselves, and may ask for down payments of 10-30 percent of the price of the vehicle (a practice, by the way, that usually covers what they paid for it).

High prices: In many instances, you can forget about Blue Book values when shopping at a buy here pay here dealer. This is the dealership of last resort for most buyers and, therefore, it’s a sellers market so you’ll find no bargains here.

Small inventory of older, higher mileage vehicles: Speaking of vehicles, you probably won’t find any new cars sitting on their lots.  In addition, since these vehicles usually don’t come with a warranty (or if they do it’s a limited one), any repairs will be on your dime.

Pay in person: Instead of a monthly payment, many dealers will ask for weekly or even bi-weekly payments, depending on your income and pay schedule. This can be a real problem if you don’t live close by.

Not always possible to rebuild credit: Finally - and here’s the kicker - since many of these dealers don’t check your credit before approving you for a loan, they may not be reporting the loan or your on-time payments to the credit bureaus. Without this information, your car loan won’t help you raise your credit score.

## On the other hand

Even with all those disadvantages, however, there’s still a place for these dealers in the marketplace, as they can be especially helpful to consumers who’ve been turned down for a car loan everywhere else.
